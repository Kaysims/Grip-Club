# User Experience

## <u>Initial discussion :</u>
Grip Club is a bouldering gym in Essex. It aims to create a friendly and social environment where people can learn/improve their bouldering skills. 
The website is being used in the hope that it will drive more individuals to come down and give bouldering a try, providing users with more information about who Grip Club is and what they offer. The contact us section has been added so that people can ask questions and give feedback.

## <u>User stories :</u>
### Client Goals

 # Design

## <u>Colour scheme : </u>

The colour palette was created using [Coolors website,](https://coolors.co/) taking into account both color psychology and accessibility. 

### Colour psychology 
* After looking into colour psychology i decided to use the colour green. The reason for this choose is that green is often associated with health and nature. Bouldering has many health benifits and although this is an indoor gym due to its location, bouldering is often assosiciated with the great outdoors. White and black were then chosen to create a clean and simple feel to the site.

    ![Colour Palate image](assets/readme-images/color-scheme-tiny.png)

### Colour accessibility 
*   To test the accessibility of the colours i used [Accessible color palette builder](https://toolness.github.io/accessible-color-matrix/?n=White&n=Black&n=Green&v=EBEBEB&v=201F1F&v=659B5E). I used this to check that the colours meet the WCAG 2.1 AA and AAA guidlines. I did double check these with [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) which gave the same results. I will only use the colours as per the below colour combinations recommended for the text and background colour.

    ![Colour Cintrast imagee](assets/readme-images/contrast-checker.png)


## <u>Typography : </u>

[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to select the typography on this site. 

* Luckiest guy is used for headings on the site. It was chosen as it has a friendly fun appearance which matches the environment Grip Club would like to create. Plus it's a San Serif typeface.
 ![Colour Palate image](assets/readme-images/title-font.png)

* Ubuntu light 300 was used for all other text on the page. It was choosen as it is a simple font. It's also a sans-serif font which is good for accessibility.
![Colour Palate image](assets/readme-images/font-text.png)

## <u>Imagery :</u>
All icons used are from [font-awesome.](https://fontawesome.com/) The images are all from [Pixels](https://www.pexels.com/). I have credited these in the below credit section. 


## <u>Wireframes : </u>

Balsamiq wireframes was used to create a template display for Desktop, tablets and phones. Some changes have been made when making the site. 

* This is the template for the hero image and about us page. ![Wireframe home and about us](assets/readme-images/about-wireframe.png)

* This is the template for the classes page. ![Wireframe classes](assets/readme-images/classes-wireframe.png)

* This is the template for the contact us page. ![Wireframe contact us](assets/readme-images/contact-wireframe.png)



## <u>Features :</u>
The website is designed to be simple and easy to use, this is achived by using common website features, like a nav bar, an icon, a contact page. The site has three pages which are all accessibile via the navigation menu. 
* ### Navigation bar:
    * The navigation bar remains fixed, and contains links to diffrent parts of the site.
    * The navigation bar is responsive as the hamburger icon allows the menu nav bar to compress on smaller screen sizes, it then has a dropdown function to select the page the user wishes to go to. 
    * The navigation bar has the Grip Club icon on the left.

* ### Home page:
    * The home page is designed to give a clear message of what this site is about. The hero image takes up the full width of the screen. The page is responsive.
    * In the center of the image is the Company name and a breif discription of what the club is.
    * A button then allows users to jump to the About Us section this will then provide further information about bouldering and the club. 

     <details><summary><b>Home Page Image</b></summary>

    ![Home Page Image](assets/readme-images/feature-hero.png)

* ### About us page:
    * The about us page is designed to provide information on what bouldering is, and more information about the club. The page is responsive.
    * There is a facilities section which will list the various facilities that the club offers. If using a smaller screen the facilities will stack on top of each other.
    * The benefits section tells the user how bouldering could benifit them, plus it has icons to catch the users attention. If using a smaller screen the benifits will stack on top of each other.

    <details><summary><b>About Us Image</b></summary>

    ![About Us Page Image](assets/readme-images/feature-about.png)
    </details><br />   

* ### Classes page: 
    * The classes page lists the diffrent classes on at Grip Club, this should encourge users to get involved. If using a smaller screen the classes will stack on top of each other.
    * Images are used to help get the users attention. And a breif text is provided about what the class is. 
    * There is a hover effect on the diffrent classes.

## <u>Future features : </u>
* ### Accessibility :
    * I have read about using :focus states when creating accessible websites. I would like to implement this once i have more understanding of how is best to use it. 
    * I have also read that implementing error messages on forms is good for improving accessibility which i would like to do in the future. 
    * Restyling of the headers so the follow logically.
* ### Icon :
    * A more sophisticated logo within the Nav bar, that customers can clearly link with bouldering and Grip Club. I used a free icon, which does not convey the club well.
* ### Events calendar :
    * A simple calendar which allows for people to see if there are any events coming up. I think this would be an engaging addition to the website for frequent users. 

## <u>Accessibility : </u>
I have made sure to implement accessibility throughout this project. From the start I have tried to make sure that accessibility is being prioritised and not compromised by the design, so that the website works for everyone. To do this i have include : 
* Semantic html.
* Descriptive alt attributes on images. 
* Making sure that the colour contrast is accessible.

# Deployment 
Initial deployment/how to fork/how to clone.

# Testing
## Testing Code Validation
* Grip Club code was tested using W3C html and css validator, and the JS hint validator for the javascript. The HTML did have an error when first tested, it was due to an a element being inside a button element. This has now been corrected and is documented below.

### HTML [W3C Html validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to test the html.
 * HTML Validation for index.html no errors were found.
 ![Html validation for index.html](assets/readme-images/index-html-checker.png)

 * HTML Validation for classes.html no errors were found.
 ![Html validation for index.html](assets/readme-images/classes-html-checker.png)

 * HTML Validation for contact.html no errors were found.

* Js Validation no errors were found.
 ![js validation](assets/readme-images/js-validator.png)

 ## Lighthouse Testing
 * Lighthouse testing was used to check the performance, accissibility, best practise and SEO of the Grip Club website. The websit went through the [Google Dev Tools.](https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/)

* ### Chrome desktop about us page Lighthouse results :
![About us desktop results](assets/readme-images/about-desktop.png)

* ### Chrome desktop classes page Lighthouse results :
![Classes desktop results](assets/readme-images/classes-desktop.png)

* ### Chrome desktop contact page Lighthouse results :
![Contact desktop results](assets/readme-images/contact-desktop.png)

* Some bugs have been fixed using Chrome dev tools prioir to this lighthouse test, this will be discussed below in fixed bugs section. 
* The perfomance was down one point across all pages, the reason shown in dev tools was "Eliminate render-blocking resources". It was in relation to my css in the head. I tried to fix this, but i could not work out how to. I have decided to leave it as it is. As this is my first project i am hoping that with further knowledge i will be able to fix this issue in the future. 
* The best practise for Grip Club classes page was down eight points. This was due to incorrect aspect ratios for the images. It was recommended to use a CDN to optimise the images, or add width and height to the html. I decided not to do this, one reason was that adding the width and height to the html impacted the responsivness. I will consider using the CDN for images in the future, but i will not have time to do this for this project. 

* ### Chrome mobile about us page Lighthouse results :
![About us mobile results](assets/readme-images/about-mobile.png)

* ### Chrome mobile classes page Lighthouse results :
![Classes mobile results](assets/readme-images/classes-mobile.png)

* ### Chrome mobile contact page Lighthouse results :
![Contact mobile results](assets/readme-images/contact-mobile.png)

* Some bugs have been fixed using Chrome dev tools prioir to this lighthouse test, this will be discussed below in fixed bugs section.
* The performance was down between 7-2 points for the mobile display. Agiain the "Eliminate render-blocking resources" was flagged in the lighthouse tests which is discussed above.
    * About us page : Dev tools says to change the png images to WebP or AVIF, i did try to do this but i still got a warning message so went back to the png images i orginally had.
    * Classes page : Dev tools says to change the png images to WebP or AVIF, i did try to do this but i still got a warning message so went back to the png images i orginally had.
    * Contact us page : Dev tools also says to enable text compression.
* The best practise for Grip Club classes page was down eight points for the same reasons as stated in the above desktop lighthouse.

* ### Lighthouse conclusion : 
    It is clear that the images used within the Grip Club website has caused points to drop across both desktop and mobile sites with the lighthouse tests. As this website is for educational purposes i am not going to make any changes, however in the future with more experiance or if this site was to go live i would address these.

## Wave tool testing
[Wave tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to further test the Grip Club site. Wave checked for any errors in the code and also that the colour contrast used in the site was accessible. Some corrections have been made prioir to these results that will be discussed in the fixed bug section. No errors have been found.
* ### Wave tool results for about us page : 
  * The results show 2 contrast errors with the h1 and p in the hero section. I am not concerned with this as the contrast has passed other contrast tests and has meet the WCAG 2.1 AA and AAA guidlines.

![About wave results](assets/readme-images/about-wave.png)

* ### Wave tool results for classes page :
![Classses wave results](assets/readme-images/classes-wave.png)

* ### Wave tool results for contact us page :
![Contact wave results](assets/readme-images/contact-wave.png)

## Manual Testing
* On top of the other tests, i also manually checked the site to make sure everything worked as expected.
  *  ### Navigation bar:
        * Tested that the links to the other pages worked coorectly and would take the user to the correct page. 
        * Tested that the fixed nav worked and that the nav stayed at the top of the screen. 
        * Tested the hamburger and that it appeared when expected. Plus that the dropdown menu also worked as expected. 
        * Tested the size of the icon text to make sure it contiuned to fit the nav bar even when the screen size was small. 

  * ### Home page:
    * Tested the hero image to make sure it expanded and shrunk with diffrent screen sizes. 
    * Tested the header and paragraph to make sure that it stayed center and readable with diffrent screen sizes. 
    * Tested the discover more button to check that it would take the user to the start off About Us section. 

  * ### About Us page:
    * Tested the text and font to make sure it was responsive.
    * Tested the facilities and benifits section to make sure the both responded the same way when the screen size got smaller. For example that the both went into a column at the same point. 
    * Checked the spelling for About Us page. 

  * ### Classes page:
    *  Tested the text and font to make sure it was responsive, and continued to fit in the card. 
    *  Tested that the images remained in the cards on diffrent screen sizes. 
    *  Checked the spelling for Classes page.
    *  Tested the link in the Hire Us card would take users to the correct page. 

  * ### Contact Us page:
    * Tested that the information section was responsive.
    * Tested that the contact form did not allow users to submit without completeing each box. 
    * Tested that when a form is submitted that Popup appears as expected. 
    * Checked the spelling for Classes page.

  * ### Footer:
    * Tested that the social media icons opened in a new top and that the links are correct.
    * Tested that the footer was responsive.


## Accessibility testing 
* To check the accessibility of Grip Club website i used [a11y.](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/) This checked the contrast and no issues were found. 

* ### A11y checker for about us page :
![ay11 results aboutus](assets/readme-images/a11y-about.png)

* ### A11y checker for classes page :
![ay11 results classes](assets/readme-images/a11y-classes.png)

* ### A11y checker for contact us page :
![ay11 results contact](assets/readme-images/a11y-contact.png)

* I also used the [A11y project checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/). 
    * It was used at the beginning of creating the site to familirise myself with accessibility. I then completed it once the site was finished. There were some things that i could not tick off such as ensuring controls have :focus states.
    * I have also jumped some headings, the reason i did this was to help with sizing of text, but know i understand that this should not have been done, and that they should follow from h1 then h2 then h3 and so on. 
    * I should have included error messages for forms, i did add a thank you popup, but this is not enough to achive accsessibility.  
    * I am hoping to learn alot more about accessibility as i progress through the code institute course.

## Responsiveness Testing
* To check the responsive design of the Grip Club Website, i used [Google Dev Tools](https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/) and [Am i responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive). This was done manually making sure that the site works across phones, tablets and computers. I found this to be the most challanging part of making this site. I hope with further learning i will be able to implement responsivness more efficently in the future. 

## Browser Compatibility
* To make sure the site is compatible across different browsers i also run lighthouse tests in the below browsers. No issues were found.

  * Google chrome 
  * Microsoft edge
  * Safari

# Bugs 
## Bugs Fixed :

 1. When the HTML validation was initially run it flagged that an a element must not be embeded in a button, which is what i had done for the hero button. This was corrected and is no longer an error.

<details><summary><b>HTML Bug Found</b></summary>

![HTML Bug Found](assets/readme-images/bug-html.png)

</details><br /> 

2. When the CSS validation was initially run it flagged two errors. One was due to an incorrect text align value being used. The other was due to an unvalid colour being used. They were both corrected and are no longer an error.

<details><summary><b>CSS Bugs Found</b></summary>

![CSS Bugs Found](assets/readme-images/bug-css.png)

</details><br /> 

3. When the orginal lighthouse test was run the SEO came back as 89 points. The reason for this was due to an error with the meta discription. I had spelt discription incorrectly. This is now fixed and is no longer an error. 

<details><summary><b>SEO Bug Found</b></summary>

![SEO Bug Found](assets/readme-images/bug-seo.png)

</details><br /> 

4. When the lighthouse test was run for the mobile devise it gave performance a mark of 83 points across all pages. The error read "Reduce the impact of third-party code". After googling this error i found that i needed to edit my font-awsome script to include an async. The async tells the browser not to download the file right away, which then allows the browser to focus on parsing the HTML. After adding the async this error is no longer showing. 

<details><summary><b>Performance Bug Found</b></summary>

![Performance Bug Found](assets/readme-images/bug-performance.png)

</details><br />

5. When i run the lighthouse test in microsoft edge it highlighted an error that google dev tools missed. At the start of the project i was going to have the icon as a link that would take the user back to the hero image. I decided in the end not to do this for various reasons. The issue was i had left the icon in a < a > tag but there was no href. This has been corrected now to a < div > and is no longer an error. 

<details><summary><b>Icon Bug Found</b></summary>

![Icon Bug Found](assets/readme-images/bug-icon.png)

</details><br />

## Bugs Unfixed :

1. Google dev tools flagged "Serve images in next-gen formats" which states that i should change the png images to WebP or AVIF format. I did attempt to do this and used a website to convert images to AVIF called [AVIF convertor](https://avif.io/) however it would not download to my computer giving me an error message. I decided to stick with the png images for this project. In the future i will try to work out and understand how to use AVIF and Webp to ensure this does not happen again. 

<details><summary><b>Next-gen Image Unfixed Bug</b></summary>

![Next-gen Image Unfixed Bug](assets/readme-images/bug-unfixed-images.png)

</details><br />

2. Google dev tools flagged "Display images with incorrect aspect ratio" this was in relation to the images on the Classes page. My understanding was that i could add a width and height to the HTML page instead of the CSS and this would fix the error. I found that this was not an option i could take as it effected the responsivness of my images. The second thing i could do is to use an image CDN, which should help with optimsing, transforming and delivery of images. I will look into how to use CDN in the future. 

<details><summary><b>Asepct-ratio Images Unfixed Bug</b></summary>

![Asepct-ratio Images Unfixed Bug](assets/readme-images/bug-unfixed-classes.png)

</details><br />

3. Google dev tools flagged "Eliminate render-blocking resources" this was an error across all pages and prevented the sites performance from getting 100 points in desktop and points knocked of for the mobile. I also run a coverage report on dev tools, to see what the render-blocking was effecting, and it showed CSS and JS was effected. From what i have read it could be due to me putting the google fonts as imports in the CSS instead of links in the head section and or somthing to do with JS. I have decided to leave this bug for this project, i am unsure of how to fix this but hope as i gain my knowledge during this course i will be able to solve this in the future.

### Acknowledgments :
This site is my first Code Institute project using CSS and HTML. I would like to thank my mentor Gareth McGirr, the slack code institute community for their help and support. Also I would like to thank the Youtube coding community, as their videos helped me develop a greater understanding of CSS and responsive design.  Building Grip club has helped me put into practise the content from code institute course, but also develop further knowledge on designing, building and testing a responsive website.
