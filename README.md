# User Experience

## <u>Initial discussion :</u>
Grip Club is a bouldering gym in Essex. It aims to create a friendly and social environment where people can learn/improve their bouldering skills. 
The website is being used in the hope that it will drive more individuals to come down and give bouldering a try, providing users with more information about who Grip Club is and what they offer. The contact us section has been added so that people can ask questions and give feedback.

## <u>User stories :</u>
### Client Goals

 # Design

## <u>Colour scheme : </u>

The colour palette was created using [Coolors website,](https://coolors.co/) taking into account both color psychology and accessibility. 

### Colour psychology 
* After looking into colour psychology i decided to use the colour green. The reason for this choose is that green is often associated with health and nature. Bouldering has many health benifits and although this is an indoor gym due to its location, bouldering is often assosiciated with the great outdoors. White and black were then chosen to create a clean and simple feel to the site.

    ![Colour Palate image](assets/readme-images/color-scheme-tiny.png)

### Colour accessibility 
*   To test the accessibility of the colours i used [Accessible color palette builder](https://toolness.github.io/accessible-color-matrix/?n=White&n=Black&n=Green&v=EBEBEB&v=201F1F&v=659B5E). I used this to check that the colours meet the WCAG 2.1 AA and AAA guidlines. I did double check these with [Adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-contrast-analyzer) which gave the same results. I will only use the colours as per the below colour combinations recommended for the text and background colour.

    ![Colour Cintrast imagee](assets/readme-images/contrast-checker.png)


## <u>Typography : </u>

[Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to select the typography on this site. 

* Luckiest guy is used for headings on the site. It was chosen as it has a friendly fun appearance which matches the environment Grip Club would like to create. Plus it's a San Serif typeface.
 ![Colour Palate image](assets/readme-images/title-font.png)

* Ubuntu light 300 was used for all other text on the page. It was choosen as it is a simple font. It's also a sans-serif font which is good for accessibility.
![Colour Palate image](assets/readme-images/font-text.png)

## <u>Imagery :</u>
All icons used are from [font-awesome.](https://fontawesome.com/) The images are all from [Pixels](https://www.pexels.com/). I have credited these in the below credit section. 


## <u>Wireframes : </u>

Balsamiq wireframes was used to create a template display for Desktop, tablets and phones. Some changes have been made when making the site. 

* This is the template for the hero image and about us page. ![Wireframe home and about us](assets/readme-images/about-wireframe.png)

* This is the template for the classes page. ![Wireframe classes](assets/readme-images/classes-wireframe.png)

* This is the template for the contact us page. ![Wireframe contact us](assets/readme-images/contact-wireframe.png)



## <u>Features :</u>
The website is designed to be simple and easy to use, this is achived by using common website features, like a nav bar, an icon, a contact page. The site has three pages which are all accessibile via the navigation menu. 
* ### Navigation bar:
    * The Navigation bar remains fixed, and contains links to diffrent parts of the site.
    * The Navigation bar is responsive as the hamburger icon allows the menu nav bar to compress on smaller screen sizes. 
    * The logo takes users back to the home page.
* ### Home page:
    * The home page is designed to give a clear message of what this site is about. The hero image takes up the full width of the screen.
    * In the center of the image is the Company name and a breif discription of the club.
    * A button then allows users to jump to the About us section this will then provide further information about bouldering and the club. 
* ### About us page:
    * The about us page is designed to provide information on what bouldering is, and more information about the club.
    * The benefits section has icons to catch the users attention. Plus it is responsive. 
    * There is a facilities section which will list the various amenitys that the Club offers. It is responsive.
* ### Classes page: 
    * This classes page lists the diffrent classes on at Grip Club, this should encourge users to get involved. 
    * Images are used to help get the users attention. It is fully responsive.
* ### Contact us page:
    * The contact page asks for the users name and email. This can nut be submitted unless the user fills this in. 
    * The contact page also has a dropdown for the user to select why they are contacting the club and a textarea for them to write a message. 
    * A submit button allows users to submit the form, but only if all sections are filled in. 
* ### Thank you pop up:
    * This pop up shows when a user has submitted a form. It will thank them for contacting Grip Club and let the user know that someone will get back to them. 
    
* ### Info section:
    * The info section provides important information about the clubs location, prices and times that they are open and closed. 
    * Icons are used to grap the users attention. Plus it is fully responsive.
* ### Footer: 
    * The footer contains links to Grip Clubs social media. They will open in a seprate tab. Icons helped keep the footer simple. 

## <u>Future features : </u>
* ### Accessibility :
    * I have read about using :focus states when creating accessible websites. I would like to implement this once i have more understanding of how is best to use it. 
    * I have also read that implementing error messages on forms is good for improving accessibility which i would like to do in the future. 
    * Restyling of the headers so the follow logically.
* ### Icon :
    * A more sophisticated logo within the Nav bar, that customers can clearly link with bouldering and Grip Club. I used a free icon, which does not convey the club well.
* ### Events calendar :
    * A simple calendar which allows for people to see if there are any events coming up. I think this would be an engaging addition to the website for frequent users. 

## <u>Accessibility : </u>
I have made sure to implement accessibility throughout this project. From the start I have tried to make sure that accessibility is being prioritised and not compromised by the design, so that the website works for everyone. To do this i have include : 
* Semantic html.
* Descriptive alt attributes on images. 
* Making buttons, a, elements have descriptive content.
* Making sure that the colour contrast is good.

# Deployment 
Initial deployment/how to fork/how to clone.

# Testing
## Testing Code Validation
* Grip Club code was tested using W3C html and css validator, and the JS hint validator for the javascript. The HTML did have an error when first tested, it was due to an a element being inside a button element. This has now been corrected and is documented below.

### HTML [W3C Html validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to test the html.
 * HTML Validation for index.html no errors were found.

 ## Lighthouse Testing
 * Lighthouse testing was used to check the performance, accissibility, best practise and SEO of the Grip Club website. The websit went through the [Google Dev Tools.](https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/)

* Chrome desktop about us page Lighthouse results :
![About us desktop results](assets/readme-images/about-desktop.png)

* Chrome desktop classes page Lighthouse results :
![Classes desktop results](assets/readme-images/classes-desktop.png)

* Chrome desktop contact page Lighthouse results :
![Contact desktop results](assets/readme-images/contact-desktop.png)

* Some bugs have been fixed using Chrome dev tools prioir to this lighthouse test, this will be discussed below in fixed bugs section. 
* The perfomance was down one point across all pages, the reason shown in dev tools was "Eliminate render-blocking resources". It was in relation to my css in the head. I tried to fix this, but i could not work out how to. I have decided to leave it as it is. As this is my first project i am hoping that with further knowledge i will be able to fix this issue in the future. 
* The best practise for Grip Club classes page was down eight points. This was due to incorrect aspect ratios for the images. It was recommended to use a CDN to optimise the images, or add width and height to the html. I decided not to do this, one reason was that adding the width and height to the html impacted the responsivness. I will consider using the CDN for images in the future, but i will not have time to do this for this project. 

* Chrome mobile about us page Lighthouse results :
![About us mobile results](assets/readme-images/about-mobile.png)

* Chrome mobile classes page Lighthouse results :
![Classes mobile results](assets/readme-images/classes-mobile.png)

* Chrome mobile contact page Lighthouse results :
![Contact mobile results](assets/readme-images/contact-mobile.png)

* Some bugs have been fixed using Chrome dev tools prioir to this lighthouse test, this will be discussed below in fixed bugs section.
* The performance was down between 7-2 points for the mobile display. Agiain the "Eliminate render-blocking resources" was flagged in the lighthouse tests which is discussed above.
    * About us page : Dev tools says to change the png images to WebP or AVIF, i did try to do this but i still got a warning message so went back to the png images i orginally had.
    * Classes page : Dev tools says to change the png images to WebP or AVIF, i did try to do this but i still got a warning message so went back to the png images i orginally had.
    * Contact us page : Dev tools also says to enable text compression.
* The best practise for Grip Club classes page was down eight points for the same reasons as stated in the above desktop lighthouse.

* ### Lighthouse conclusion : 
    It is clear that the images used within the Grip Club website has caused points to drop across both desktop and mobile sites with the lighthouse tests. As this website is for educational purposes i am not going to make any changes, however in the future with more experiance or if this site was to go live i would address these.

## Wave tool testing
[Wave tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to further test the Grip Club Site. Wave checked for any errors and colour contrast. Some corrections have been made prioir to these results that will be discussed in the fixed bug section. 
* Wave tool results for about us page : 
  * The results show 2 contrast errors with the h1 and p in the hero section. I am not concerned with this as the contrast has passed other contrast tests and has meet the WCAG 2.1 AA and AAA guidlines.

  ![About wave results](assets/readme-images/about-wave.png)

* Wave tool results for classes page :
![Classses wave results](assets/readme-images/classes-wave.png)

* Wave tool results for contact us page :
![Contact wave results](assets/readme-images/contact-wave.png)

## Accessibility testing 
* To check the accessibility of Grip Club website i used [a11y.](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/) This checked the contrast and no issues were found. 

* A11y checker for about us page :
![ay11 results aboutus](assets/readme-images/a11y-about.png)

* A11y checker for classes page :
![ay11 results classes](assets/readme-images/a11y-classes.png)

* A11y checker for contact us page :
![ay11 results contact](assets/readme-images/a11y-contact.png)

* I also used the [A11y project checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/). 
    * It used at the beginning of creating the site to familirise myself with accessibility. I then completed it once the site was finished. There were some things that i could not tick off such as ensuring controls have :focus states.
    * I have also jumped some headings, the reason i did this was to help with sizing of text, but know i understand that this should not have been done, and that they should follow from h1 then h2 then h3 and so on. 
    * I should have included error messages for when forms have been submitted, i did add a thank you popup, but this is not enough to achive accsessibility.  
    * I am hoping to learn alot more about accessibility as i progress through the code institute course.

### Acknowledgments :
This site is my first Code Institute project using CSS and HTML. I would like to thank my mentor Gareth McGirr, the slack code institute community for their help and support. Also I would like to thank the Youtube coding community, as their videos helped me develop a greater understanding of CSS and responsive design.  Building Grip club has helped me put into practise the content from code institute course, but also develop further knowledge on designing, building and testing a responsive website.
